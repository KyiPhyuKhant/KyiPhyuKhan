👋 Hi there, I'm Kyi!

👨‍💻 I'm a Front-End developer with 9+ years of experience in developing website layouts, visual appearance, and content formatting. My expertise lies in dynamic website production and responsive web development, as well as troubleshooting software bugs and integrating systems to meet clients' needs. I also review code to ensure it meets industry and company standards and is compatible with all major browsers, devices, and operating systems.

🚀 I am always eager to expand my skillset and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Currently, I am learning ReactJS and improving my skills in User Experience (UX) design.
