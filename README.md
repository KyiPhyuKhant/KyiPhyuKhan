Hi, I'm Kyi, 

A Front-End developer with 9+ years of experience in developing website layouts, visual appearance, and content formatting. I specialize in dynamic website production and responsive web development, troubleshoot software bugs and integrate systems to meet clients' needs, and review code to ensure it meets industry and company standards and is compatible with all major browsers, devices, and operating systems.

I am always looking to expand my skillset and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Currently, I am learning ReactJS and improving my skills in User Experience (UX) design.

Thanks for checking out my profile! If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, don't hesitate to contact me. Additionally, I'm always eager to learn new things, so feel free to share your knowledge with me.
